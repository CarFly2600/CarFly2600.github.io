        <h2>1 What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>

        <p>The first thing I paid attention to was the mainly black and white colour scheme. It gave a feel of simplicity which gave me the impression that this was not going to be too mentally challenging.</p>

        <h2>2	Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Opened Strike. </li>
            <li>Draw some lines like in Microsoft Paint. </li>
            <li>Touched a couple of buttons on the menu but nothing happened. </li>
            <li>Erased some of my lines. </li>
            <li>Changed the thickness of the brush. </li>
            <li>Undid or redid some things. </li>
            <li>Held down Shift, but nothing. </li>
            <li>Added in fills to come closed in areas drawn using the bucket button. </li>
            <li>Changed the style of fills. </li>
            <li>Looked through the menu to see functions. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3	What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>

        <p>I spent most of my time just drawing lines like on Paint. I got the impression that was what the developer wanted the next user to focus on considering it was at the top of the side bar, like in Adobe products. </p>
        
        <h2>4	What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h2>

        <p>Drawing a line seemed to be the most common action during the experience. This was extended by modifying the stroke of the brush to make bigger and thicker lines across the canvas. </p>

        <h2>5	What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>

        <p>My impression of the intended primary goal of the experience was the curiosity to see what type of website Strike really is and why it was created in the first place. </p>

        <h2>6	What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h2>

        <p>My impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal is blunt given the simplistic design of the website. </p>

        <h2>7	What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>

        <p>My impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time considers the opinions of other potential users. The time should probably at least be around 5 minutes and probably at least once. </p>

        <h2>8	What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>

        <p>My impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be done overtime is nothing urgent and sort of laid back. The simplistic design makes it easy for the software inexperienced user to get a sense of a simplistic function that some tother more advanced software may have. </p>

        <h2>9	What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>

        <p>As well as Microsoft Paint, Strike’s paint brush tool also references a few of the Adobe software such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Although this could not really give an accurate idea of the paint brush tool of the adobe software. </p>

        <h2>10	What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h2>

        <p>These references suggest to me that I should just treat this as a paint brush starting point because the design doesn’t really state that Strike it made for digital artists to create their art, even if it fits the black and white colour palette of the website. </p>
       
        <h2>11	What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h2>

        <p>These references suggest that I should feel pretty easy about it due to the simplistic design. This means I won’t have to deal with as big a mental headache when starting with more advanced software for the first time. Having similar tools also gives an idea of how they might function in other products. </p>

        <h2>12	What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h2>

        <p>There was no real element of frustration during the experience. The only real downside is the simplistic design makes it slightly boring compared to other more high-tech websites. It’s frustrating because it makes me feel like the website isn’t finished yet and that I am just using a prototype instead of the finished product. </p>

        <h2>13	What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h2>

        <p>Not a big sense of satisfaction was found either, but the most satisfying element would have to be the different fill designs. They were satisfying because of the multiple different interesting designs they offered by differently spacing out differently sized dots in each design.  </p>
